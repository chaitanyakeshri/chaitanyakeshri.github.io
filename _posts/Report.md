## 1. Airfoil Creation and Meshing
As per my roll number (22B2472) the required wing is a NACA 7411 airfoil which has the following properties

### Meshing
For creating a good mesh for running the simulations , the CAD model with the fluid and cavity of the airfoil was divided into 6 partitions for studying the flow indidualy in these regions following best practices.
